    Read the analysis provided below and select 3-4 Star Wars characters who would
    have interesting perspectives to discuss these findings in a conversation.

    Analysis from transcript:
    {analysis}

    Choose characters whose personalities, experiences, and speaking styles will create
    engaging dialogue. Consider:
    - Different perspectives (optimist vs skeptic, master vs apprentice, leader vs soldier)
    - Distinct speaking patterns (Yoda's syntax, Han's casualness, Obi-Wan's wisdom)
    - Relevant experiences from their stories that connect to the analysis topics

    Pick characters from the main films and popular series who audiences know well.
  expected_output: >
    A list of 3-4 Star Wars characters with:
    1. Character name
    2. Why they were chosen (personality and speaking style)
    3. What perspective they'll bring to discussing the analysis
    Keep it concise - just the essential information needed for writing their dialogue.

dialogue_creation_task:
  description: >
    Write a conversation between the selected Star Wars characters where they discuss
    the analysis findings. Use ONLY dialogue - no narration, no descriptions, no stage
    directions.

    Analysis they're discussing:
    {analysis}

    CRITICAL RULES:
    - Write ONLY what the characters say
    - Format: CHARACTER NAME: their words
    - NO scene descriptions, NO narration, NO stage directions
    - Characters must reference ACTUAL content from the analysis above
    - Stay authentic to each character's voice and speech patterns
    - Let them have a natural back-and-forth conversation
    - They should discuss, question, agree, disagree, make connections
    - Length: 15-25 lines of dialogue

    Example of correct format:
    YODA: Interesting, this Feature X is. Faster experimentation, they promise.
    OBI-WAN: Indeed, Master Yoda. The transcript mentions a 43% reduction in latency.
    HAN: Sounds too good to be true. What's the catch with this new billing system?

    Write the conversation in this exact format - pure dialogue only.
  expected_output: >
    A conversation in screenplay format with ONLY character dialogue.
    Format: CHARACTER NAME: what they say
    No narration. No descriptions. No stage directions. Just the characters talking.
    The conversation must reference specific points from the analysis.
    15-25 lines of dialogue total.
